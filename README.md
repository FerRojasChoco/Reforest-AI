### AI/ML Project
This is our first AI/ML related project, which we developed using Google Colab.  

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop and train a model for forest monitoring and detecting the best areas of carbon sequestration potential (see the pdf file for detailed information)
Project Structure
The repository contains the following main files:

**archive.zip**: This file contains the dataset and model training files.
dataInit.py**: This file is used to initialize and process the dataset.
processAndTrain.py: This file contains the code for training the AI/ML model.
The HTML files (index.html, phase1.html, phase2.html) and related assets are part of a sample website we created to explain the project.
The pdf file contains more detailed information about the project, including the methodology, results, and future improvements.

## Running the Project
To run this project, you will need to have access to Google Colab. The code files can be uploaded to a Colab notebook, and the dataset can be extracted from the archive.zip file.
The dataInit.py and processAndTrain.py files can then be executed to train the model.
