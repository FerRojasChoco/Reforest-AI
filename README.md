AI/ML Project
This is our first AI/ML related project, which we developed using Google Colab.
Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop and train a model for forest monitoring and detecting the best areas of carbon sequestration potential (see the pdf file for detailed information)
Project Structure
The repository contains the following main files:

archive.zip: This file contains the dataset and model training files.
dataInit.py: This file is used to initialize and process the dataset.
processAndTrain.py: This file contains the code for training the AI/ML model.
The HTML files (index.html, phase1.html, phase2.html) and related assets are part of a sample website we created to explain the project.
The pdf file contains more detailed information about the project, including the methodology, results, and future improvements.

Running the Project
To run this project, you will need to have access to Google Colab. The code files can be uploaded to a Colab notebook, and the dataset can be extracted from the archive.zip file.
The dataInit.py and processAndTrain.py files can then be executed to train the model.
